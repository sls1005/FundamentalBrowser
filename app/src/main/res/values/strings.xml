    <string name="doc_title1">1. UI</string>
    <string name="doc_title1_1">i. The URL bar</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_1_1">The URL bar of this app is a little different from that of other browsers. It is still the place where the URL is displayed or edited, but now it is usually hidden and only shows up when the user needs it.\n\nWhen you need to see the URL bar, tap on the ‘<code>://</code>’ symbol if it is present in the top bar, or use the ‘Show/hide URL bar’ or ‘Edit URL’ option from the menu that is opened by tapping the three-dot icon in the top bar. Tapping the ‘<code>://</code>’ symbol once again (if it is present) will close the URL bar if it is already opened.\n\nThe URL bar allows multiline editing, that is, text that is too long will be wrapped to the next line. This makes it easier to view and edit when the URL is very long.\n\nThere are several buttons at the bottom of the URL bar. Those are:\n</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_1_2"><b>Go</b>: load the web page corresponding to a given URL. Unlike the ‘Search’ button, this does not do search.\n\n<b>Search</b>: search the web by using the text in the URL field as keywords. Only usable if the ‘search URL’ is set. Unlike the ‘Go’ button, this will not load a URL but… will search for it.\n\n<b>Copy</b>: copy the text in the URL field, or the selected text in the URL field, if any.\n\n<b>Paste</b>: paste the text to the URL field, either at the end of text or at the selected position if any text is selected.\n\n<b>Clear</b>: clear the URL field, removing all text.\n\n<b>Restore</b>: replace any text in the URL field with a previously loaded URL. This can also be used if the field is empty, in which case the previously loaded URL will still be restored, if any.\n\n<b>Decode</b>: decode the URL if it is pct-encoded. See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 for more details about pct-encoding.\n\n<b>Close</b>: close the URL bar.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title1_2">ii. The main window</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_2">This is where the web page is displayed.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title1_3">iii. The log</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_3">The log is a record of the web requests this app has made, including the requests for images, scripts, data (JSON) and other kinds of resources. It also contains the output of each script that has been run.\n\nTo open the log, use the ‘view log’ option from the option menu. The option is only available if there is anything in the log.\n\nEach request-related entry consists of:\n  (1) the method, e.g., GET.\n  (2) if it is a redirection, a string that indicates so.\n  (3) the URL associated with that request.\n\nUsing the back button of the device (or an equivalent gesture) will close the log.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2">2. Usage</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_1">i. Load a URL</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_1">To load a URL, paste it to the URL field and then tap ‘Go’\n.</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_2">ii. Search the web</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_2">To do search, firstly set the search URL in settings and enter the keyword, and then tap ‘Search’.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_3">iii. Search a web page</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_3">To do search in a web page, use the ‘search content’ option from the option menu (only available if any page is loaded).\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_4">iv. View the source code</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_4">To see the source code of a web page, add ‘view-source:’ to the start of the URL that points to it. For example: ‘<code>view-source:https://example.com/index.html</code>’. This usage is supported through the framework.\nTo search in the source code, use the ‘search content’ option as if it were a normal web page.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_5">v. The console mode</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_5">To enter the console mode, input some code with the ‘<code>javascript:</code>’ prefix (e.g., ‘<code>javascript:console.log(0);</code>’) into the URL field while the log is already opened, and then tap ‘Go’. The result will be shown on the screen. You can also use the (experimental) ‘Run’ button to do that.\n\nUsing a commend prefixed with ‘<code>javascript:</code>’ in any other situation will cause it to be executed normally, as if loading a URL. The execution of such code, even in the console mode, is never handled by this app, but by the framework or system. This app only implemented the logic to display the log messages.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_6">vi. Logging</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_6">The ‘foreground logging’ feature gives you some meta-information about the page you are reading. The format of it is the same as that of a log entry. See above for more details.\n</string>
