    <string name="doc_title1">1. UI</string>
    <string name="doc_title1_1">i. The URL bar</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_1_1">The URL bar of this app is a little different from that of other browsers. It is still the place where the URL is displayed or edited, but now it is usually hidden and only shows up when the user needs it.\n\nWhen you need to see the URL bar, tap on the ‘<code>://</code>’ symbol if it is present in the top bar, or use the ‘Show/hide URL bar’ or ‘Edit URL’ option from the menu that is opened by tapping the three-dot icon in the top bar. Tapping the ‘<code>://</code>’ symbol once again (if it is present) will close the URL bar if it is already opened.\n\nThe URL bar allows multiline editing, that is, text that is too long will be wrapped to the next line. This makes it easier to view and edit when the URL is very long.\n\nThere are several buttons at the bottom of the URL bar. Those are:\n</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_1_2"><b>Load</b>: load the web page corresponding to a given URL. Unlike the ‘Search’ button, this does not do search.\n\n<b>Search</b>: search the web by using the text in the URL field as keywords. Only usable if the ‘search URL’ is set. Unlike the ‘Load’ button, this will not load a URL but… will search for it.\n\n<b>Copy</b>: copy the text in the URL field, or the selected text in the URL field, if any.\n\n<b>Paste</b>: paste the text to the URL field, either at the end of text or at the selected position if any text is selected.\n\n<b>Clear</b>: clear the URL field, removing all text.\n\n<b>Restore</b>: replace any text in the URL field with a previously loaded URL. This can also be used if the field is empty, in which case the previously loaded URL will still be restored, if any.\n\n<b>Edit</b>: show the UI for editing the URL. It uses the entire screen to display the URL.\n\n<b>Decode</b>: decode the URL if it is pct-encoded. See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 for more details about pct-encoding.\n\n<b>Close</b>: close the URL bar.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title1_2">ii. The main window</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_2">This is where the web page is displayed.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title1_3">iii. The log</string>
    <string name="doc_text1_3">The log is a record of the web requests this app has made, including the requests for images, scripts, data (e.g., JSON) and other kinds of resources. It also contains the output of each script that has been run.\n\nTo open the log, use the ‘view log’ option from the option menu. The option is only available if there is anything in the log.\n\nEach request-related entry consists of:\n  (1) the method, e.g., GET.\n  (2) if it is the result of a redirection, a string that indicates so.\n  (3) the URL associated with that request.\n\nTo search for a specific record in the log, use the ‘Search in log’ option from the option menu. The option will be available when you open the menu while the log is opened.\n\nUsing the back button of the device (or an equivalent gesture) will close the log.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2">2. Usage</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_1">i. Load a URL</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_1">To load a URL, paste it to the URL field and then tap ‘Load’.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_2">ii. Search the web</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_2">To do search, firstly set the search URL in settings and enter the keyword, and then tap ‘Search’.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_3">iii. Search a web page</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_3">To do search in a web page, use the ‘search content’ option from the option menu (only available if any page is loaded).\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_4">iv. View the source code</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_4">To see the source code of a web page, add ‘view-source:’ to the start of the URL that points to it. For example: ‘<code>view-source:https://example.com/index.html</code>’. This usage is supported through the framework.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the ‘view the source code of this page’ option hidden in the submenu that is opened by tapping the three-dot icon and then tapping ‘more’. You may set in the settings the source viewer implementation that will perform this task. The default is ‘native’, which means the task is processed by the framework. However, if it doesn\'t work on your device, you may instead set it to ‘alternative’, which means that this app will use a different approach to do that.\n\nTo search in the source code, you may use the ‘search content’ option as if it were a normal web page. This is currently only supported if you are using the ‘native’ approach.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_5">v. Console and REPL</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_5">To use the console and REPL features, input some code (should normally be JS code) into the URL field and use the ‘Run’ button (enabled in settings) to execute it. The execution of such code, even in the console mode, is never handled by this app, but by the framework or system. This app only implemented the logic to display the log messages.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_6">vi. Logging</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_6">The ‘foreground logging’ feature gives you some meta-information about the page you are reading. The format of it is the same as that of a log entry. See above for more details.\n</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_7">vii. Using this app as a generalised intent sender or activity launcher</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_7">By using some code that looks like ‘<b><code>location.href=\"intent:#Intent;...;end\"</code></b>’, you can utilise this app as a generalised intent sender and activity launcher (by specifying ‘action’, ‘component’, etc. in the form of text), with the restriction that, the intent can only be sent to an app other than this application. For security concerns, this app will refuse to send such an intent if it detects its own package name in the URI or intent, in which case it can show an error message and might not log.\n\nIntent scheme URIs are half-supported by this app. That is to say, they will usually be processed correctly, but this app usually doesn\'t check if a URI is an ‘<b><code>intent:</code></b>’ URI, except when trying to protect itself from intent-based attacks. (See https://www.mbsd.jp/Whitepaper/IntentScheme.pdf for information about this issue.)\n\nInstead, `<b><code>intent:</code></b>` URIs will be treated as if they were URIs of unrecognised schemes (such as ‘<b><code>abc://</code></b>’), for any of which this app will ask the user whether to launch an intent, except in the specific situations mentioned above.</string>
    <string name="doc_title2_8">viii. Locally loading and debugging HTML</string>
    <string name="doc_text2_8">To locally load and debug a piece of HTML code, you may load it as a <b><code>data:</code></b> URI (by prefixing it with ‘<b><code>data:text/html,</code></b>’ or ‘<b><code>data:,</code></b>’). This usage is half-supported by this application through the framework.\n\nAlternatively, you may use the ‘Load HTML code’ option in the submenu that is opened by tapping the three-dot icon and then tapping ‘more’. You must enable the ‘advanced developer tools’ option in the settings of this app in order to see the option in the submenu.  If you use this method, this app will automatically convert the HTML code into a data URI and present it in the URL field. The data URI will be pct-encoded, which means you may load it into another browser that supports doing so. The ‘Decode’ button below the URL field can be used to decode the pct-encoded string and restore the HTML code.</string>
